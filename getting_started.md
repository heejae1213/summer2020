# Welcome interns!
This guide will give you an overview of how to get started working on the SAGE project.

## Part 1: What is SAGE?
The Sage project's goal is to design and build a new kind of national-scale reusable cyberinfrastructure to enable AI at the edge. To learn about the project, check out the GitHub page, https://github.com/sagecontinuum/sage , and the SAGE project's website, https://sagecontinuum.org/ . I encourage you to explore the SAGE GitHub repository to learn the layout of the project. Be sure to write down any questions you may have while exploring the SAGE GitHub repository. When finshed overlooking the repository, contact Raj regarding questions about the SAGE GitHub repository.

## Part 2: Agile
Upon overviewing the repository, the next step is to go over the Agile framework. Agile is a workflow that promotes rapid prototyping and efficiency. The SAGE project is following an Agile framework. To learn about the Agile framework, contact Joseph Swantek on Slack. Ask for a pdf that goes over Agile. The pdf will have an overview of how the project is using Agile, and it will also have a link to a six-part video series explaining Agile. 

## Part 3: Docker
For the SAGE project, the application Docker is being used extensively. Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Take some time to learn the fundamentals of Docker. Here's a link to a short and friendly tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S73WERRqO4. Feel free to watch or use any resources to learn about Docker. 

## Part 4: ...
Now that you have finished steps 1-3, report into Raj. New steps will be added as we figure out what's going on :)
